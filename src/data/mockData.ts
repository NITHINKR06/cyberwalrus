2FA adds an extra security layer beyond just passwords.

## Types of 2FA:

## Why It Matters:
Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without the second factor.

## Best Practices:
- Enable 2FA on all important accounts
- Use authenticator apps over SMS when possible
- Keep backup codes in a secure location
- Register multiple 2FA methods when available`,

    title: 'Social Engineering Awareness',
    description: 'Understand psychological manipulation tactics',

Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## Common Tactics:

- Baiting (offering something desirable)
- Quid pro quo (promising a benefit)
- Tailgating (physical unauthorized access)

## Red Flags:
- Unusual requests from known contacts
- Pressure to act immediately
- Requests to bypass normal procedures
- Too-good-to-be-true offers

## Defense Strategies:
- Verify identities through separate channels
- Question unusual requests
- Follow security protocols strictly
- Report suspicious interactions`,
